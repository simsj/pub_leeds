##Abstract  
This article describes a reproducible implementation of the genetic genealogy technique known as the Leeds Method in the R statistical programming environment.  

##Introduction  
One of the most challenging tasks genetic genealogists face is properly categorizing autosomal DNA matches as being due to DNA inherited from specific ancestors. The Leeds Method[^1], developed by Dana Stewart Leeds, is a method to summarize predicted second cousin (2C) and third cousin (3C) matches at AncestryDNA.  The method produces a table that seeks to answer the question, are my DNA cousins also DNA cousins? The output of the method, as originally developed, is a table that has eight or so different groups of matches representing matches that are related to the test-taker through each of the test-taker's eight great-grandparents. Whether the groups created by the grouping procedure are due to DNA inherited through each of the eight great-grandparents will vary from test-taker to test-taker for several reasons including who has tested DNA in the vendor's database.  

As the technique was initially described, the names of a test-taker's predicted 2C and 3C matches at AncestryDNA are transcribed (or copied and pasted) in rank order into a table with the names of matches forming the first, left-most column of a table. A spreadsheet provides an easily modifiable way to build a table, but the method could also be implemented with paper and colored pencils or markers. If there are any matches in this list that share 400 cM of DNA or more with the test-taker, they are removed from the table. The method then applies a few simple rules to build new columns in the table by applying the rules to the entire table from the top of the table to the bottom of the table in a row-wise fashion.  Each new column in the table produced by the method represents a group of shared matches.

##Data sources 
AncestryDNA does not provide customers with a method to download their match list or their in-common-with matches (shared matches) list for use off-line.  On August 15, 2018, the commercially available DNAGedcom Client[^2] software package was used to download the author's match list and the in-common-with matches in two separate .csv format files from his account at AncestryDNA. These files provide a snapshot of the author's account on that particular day. 

The data in these .csv files was imported into the free version of the R statistical programming environment[^3] using the free version of RStudio[^4], an integrated development environment for R. The tidyverse package[^5] for R was loaded first to make coding easier and more readable by humans.  

These data sources are not included in the Github repository with this article due to privacy considerations[^6].

```{r importdata,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# create variables with file names to be used
match_file <- "m_test_taker.csv"
icw_file <- "icw_test_taker.csv"

# import the matches file
matches <- read_csv(match_file)

# import in-common-with matches file  
icw_matches <- read_csv(icw_file)
```

There were `r nrow(matches)` rows of data, one row per match, in the matches file. There were `r nrow(icw_matches)` rows of data in-common-with file.  

The matches file had a total of `r ncol(matches)` columns of information about each match. The names of those columns are given by the output of the following code chunk.    
```{r}
colnames(matches)
```

The in-common-with matches file had a total of `r ncol(icw_matches)` columns of information about each match. The names of those columns are given by the output of the following code chunk. 

```{r}
colnames(icw_matches)
```

##Implementing the Leeds Method
The match list was pared down to just those matches that are predicted 2C and 3C cousins, and then a second filter was applied to remove any matches that shared 400 cM or more DNA with the author as shown in the R code chunk below.  
```{r}
# filter matches to include only predicted 2C and 3C
filtered_matches <- filter(matches, range %in% c("SECOND_COUSIN",
                                                 "THIRD_COUSIN"))

# filter out any matches that are greater than or equal to 400 cM
filtered_matches <- filter(filtered_matches,sharedCM < 400)
```

After applying these filters, there were `r nrow(filtered_matches)` rows of data, one row per match.  The filtered matches appeared to be sorted by shared cM values in descending order, and the following code explicitly does this to be sure of the order.  
```{r}
# sort filtered_matches high to low
filtered_matches <- arrange(filtered_matches, desc(sharedCM))
```

Looking at this filtered list of matches, the predicted cousin frequencies were as follows.
```{r}
# summarize filtered_matches by predicted range so far
table(filtered_matches$range)
```

The number of columns of data describing each match was reduced in this implementation because not all of the information was needed for this article.   
```{r}
# retain all rows, but only include these columns
group_these <- select(filtered_matches,c(2,4,3,5,6,8,9))
```

The names of columns retained for each match in the grouping procedure are given in the following code output.  
```{r}
colnames(group_these)
```

A custom function was written to look-up the in-common-with matches for any given match in the table, and this is shown in the following code chunk.  
```{r getmatch_icw, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE}
getmatch_icw <- function(amatchid,icw_matches){
  # takes an AncestryDNA matchid value
  # takes the in-common-with match dataframe
  # returns the matchids for the shared matches
  temp <- filter(icw_matches,matchid == amatchid) %>%
    # column 4 contains the icwids
    select(4)
  temp
}
```

The Leeds Method grouping procedure was implemented as a function in R, and this is shown in the code output below.  
```{r, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
get_leeds <- function(thedf,theicws){
  for(i in 1:nrow(thedf)){
  if(i==1){
    # need to add the first new column to grouped dataframe, initially empty
    grouped <- mutate(thedf,G1 = "")
    #populate column cells with the value TRUE when a match shares a match
    testing <- getmatch_icw(grouped$matchid[i],theicws)
    scoreTRUE <- which(apply(grouped,1, function(r) any(r %in% testing$icwid)))
    scoreTRUE <- c(i,scoreTRUE)
    grouped[scoreTRUE,ncol(grouped)] <- TRUE
  }
  # need to test row for any TRUE values for columns beginning with G
  # if TRUE is found, skip this row when building new columns
  # because this match has been previously grouped; 
  # otherwise create a new column
  checkrow <- grouped[i,]
  if(sum(apply(checkrow,2,function(s) any(s == TRUE)))==0){
    #this is a row that needs to have a new column started for it
    varname <- paste("G",ncol(grouped) - 6,sep="")
    grouped[[varname]] <- ""
    testing <- getmatch_icw(grouped$matchid[i],theicws)
    scoreTRUE <- which(apply(grouped,1, function(r) any(r %in% testing$icwid)))
    scoreTRUE <- c(i,scoreTRUE)
    grouped[scoreTRUE,ncol(grouped)] <- TRUE
  }
  }
  # return a dataframe with output of the Leeds Method grouping
  grouped
}
```

To run the R version of the Leeds Method grouping procedure, calling the function get_leeds and passing it the table of matches to be grouped and the name of the in-common-with match table is all that is required as shown in the following code chunk.  
```{r}
# apply the Leeds Method grouping procedure  
leeds_groups <- get_leeds(group_these,icw_matches)
```

In this particular case, the number of groups created by the Leeds Method is shown in the output of the code chunk below.  
```{r}
ncol(select(leeds_groups,starts_with("G")))
```

The following code chunk shows the names of the columns in the table after the Leeds Method grouping procedure was applied to the table.  The columns with the name starting with G are the new columns created by this implementation of the procedure.  Each column name beginning with G is a group of shared matches.  

```{r}
colnames(leeds_groups)
```

The following code writes the grouped match table to disk as a .csv file. The file can be opened in a spreadsheet for viewing and further analysis.   
```{r}
write_csv(leeds_groups,"matches_grouped_by_leeds.csv")
```

For this article, an anonymous version of the output was saved to disk as an example that can be shared with the genetic genealogy community.  
```{r writesharableoutput}
leeds_groups_anon <- select(leeds_groups,3:ncol(leeds_groups))
for(i in 1:nrow(leeds_groups_anon)){
  leeds_groups_anon$name[i] <- paste("match",i,sep=" ")
}
write_csv(leeds_groups_anon,"leeds_grouped_anon.csv")
```

In the case of the anonymous version of the output, the following columns (variables) of the output were written to disk as a .csv file. The *people* variable is an integer with the number of people in a tree that is linked to the match.  If the match has a tree at Ancestry.com but it is not linked to the kit, the value for people will be zero. The *sharedSegments* variable is an integer with the number of shared segments each match shares with the test-taker, in this case, the author of this article.  





```{r}
colnames(leeds_groups_anon)
```

In the anonymous output, the actual names were replaced with names such as match 1, match 2, etc. as shown in the output of the code chunk below.   
```{r}
leeds_groups_anon$name
```

A screen shot of the table with anonymous output is shown in Figure 1.  This was made by opening the anonymous output .csv file with a spreadsheet application and then invoking one of the screen capture tools built into the macOS.  Figure 2 shows a colorized version of the table after the author applied coloring by hand.

##Discussion 
As implemented in this article, the R version of the Leeds Method inserts the word TRUE in a cell of a spreadsheet (that can be viewed from the .csv output of the code) rather than assigning that cell the group color when there is a shared match.  This allows the genetic genealogist to use any color scheme they choose when they use the output for further analysis. In this implementation, each match group is assigned a sequential name (column name) beginning with G1, G2, through G*n* rather than a color representing the "name" of the match group. This was done in anticipation of expanding the use of the Leeds Method to include hundreds or thousands of 4C matches, which may result in a inconvenient number of groups requiring different colors.   

There are several compelling aspects of the Leeds Method for summarizing autosomal DNA matches as originally implemented.  It does not require advanced knowledge of genetic genealogy to implement. It does not require advanced computer skills to implement, and it does not require any prior knowledge of the families in the match list or in the in-common-with matches.  These aspects of the method make it very appealing when *beginning* to assess how matches are related to a test-taker.  If there are only a couple of dozen or so matches that meet the Leeds Method criteria, the method is relatively straight forward to implement by hand on an *ad hoc* basis.    

Given all of the above mentioned positive aspects of the Leeds Method, why re-implement the method in computer code? In a word, reproducibility.  Reproducibility is one of the fundamental requirements of sound genealogical research. Reproducibility means given a set of genealogical and genetic data, can another person reproduce the previous analysis.  

Genetic genealogists need to be aware that vendor databases containing the source data for their genetic analyzes are dynamic and not static.  Match lists change over time. Not only can new matches appear over time, customers are also free to remove their data from vendor databases. Genetic genealogists need a convenient snapshot of their genetic data sources that they use in an analysis.  Downloaded match lists and in-common-with match lists like those produced by the DNAGedcom Client software can be used for this purpose.  

Today, if the diligent genetic genealogist chooses to go the reproducible route and perform analyses on snapshots of their genetic data, and does not reply on dynamic web site screens, they face some serious skills hurdles. For example, without the right software tools, it's not easy to deal with tens or hundreds of thousands of rows of data. Computer programming in general, and the R statistical programming environment used here, are not in the common skill set of the current generation of the most avid of genealogists. Computer programming has a very steep learning curve.  That said, there are skilled programmers who can take code similar to that used here, and re-implement it in R or in some other programming language with a web page interface to reduce the computer skill set required for genetic genealogists to improve the reproducibility of their genetic genealogy research.  The author of this article does not have the skills required to provide an automated Leeds Method service via the web given a pair of .csv input files. He hopes some enterprising programmer will create an easy-to-use automated tool for this purpose. Ideally, that programmer would make the implementation an open-source project, so the computer code can be inspected and tested for reproducibility by the genetic genealogy community.    

If it were the case that genetic genealogists had an easy-to-use, automated Leeds Method tool that was capable of being applied to larger data sets, such as those including hundreds or thousands of 4C matches, today they still have considerable hurdles when they try to interpret the groups produced by the Leeds Method.  Some of the issues are related to understanding the possibilities of an in-common-with match group and this is discussed elsewhere[^7]. An additional problem is that of DNA matches with no trees and very short trees linked to their DNA kit.  For example, in this article, of the `r nrow(leeds_groups_anon)` matches that were grouped by the Leeds Method, `r nrow(filter(leeds_groups_anon,people==0))` had zero people in a tree linked to their DNA result. Hopefully, in the future people who take a DNA test for some purpose other than genealogy will become interested in genealogy and this situation will improve. For the present, inspecting matches by hand online to discover un-linked trees, and contacting matches and patiently waiting for a reply seems to be the prudent approach.

##Software  
DNAGedcom Client version 2.1.6 (2.18) for Mac was used to download data from the author's account at AncestryDNA.  The free `r R.version.string` was used for this analysis. The code was developed in RStudio version 1.1.456. The tidyverse package version 1.2.1 was used to make coding easier and more readable for humans.  This report was produced within the RStudio integrated development environment using rmarkdown version 1.10 and the knitr package version 1.2. and its dependencies. MacTeX-2018 was used for pdf output on a 2017 MacBook Pro running macOS version 10.13.6 (17G65), which is commonly called High Sierra.
